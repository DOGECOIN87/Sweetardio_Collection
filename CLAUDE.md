# Sweetardio Collection — project notes

## Lighting convention

**The light originates from the TOP LEFT.** This is the collection's fixed key
light and every asset must be lit consistently with it:

- Key light from the **upper left**, roughly 45°.
- Cooler, dimmer fill from the lower right.
- Highlights and catchlights land on the **upper-left** face of a form.
- The terminator and the deepest ambient occlusion fall on the **lower-right**
  and outer rim, with a rim light picking that edge back out.
- Cast shadows therefore fall **down and to the right** of the caster.

Anything generated, re-rendered or hand-authored for this collection — skins,
eyes, mouths, characters, arms, footwear, stickers — follows this. An asset lit
from another direction will not sit with the rest of the cast.

Where this is already encoded:

- `SKIN_ENHANCE_PROMPTS.md`, `EYEZ_ENHANCE_PROMPTS.md`,
  `MOUTHZ_ENHANCE_PROMPTS.md` — every prompt specifies the upper-left key.
- `asset_assessment/shade_cyan_skin.py` — documents the measured convention
  ("top-left light, lower-edge falloff") and the limb-luma ratios that prove it
  across the skin balls.

- `GROUND_SHADOW` in `generator.py` — the cast shadow is offset per mode:
  `drop_dx`/`drop_dy` push the floating characters' shadow down and to the
  right at 45°, while the contact pool keeps `dx: 0` because a pool sits under
  its caster whatever the key light is doing.

## Canvas and face rule

- Canvas is **1393 × 1393**.
- The skin ball, eyes and mouth composite at **fixed canvas positions**; the
  ball centre is ~(690, 601) and every character's face hole is drawn around
  it. Nothing moves to meet a layer that drifted, so footprints and positions
  must be preserved exactly when an asset is re-authored.
- `ball_fit()` sizes every skin ball from the **widest eye**, so eye width is
  load-bearing across the whole collection.

## Verification tools

```bash
python3 asset_assessment/verify_placement.py    # where characters actually land
python3 asset_assessment/audit_placement.py     # what CHAR_Y_ADJUST should be
python3 asset_assessment/render_sample_sheet.py # N random tokens, full pipeline
```

`verify_placement.py` exits non-zero if any character is off its group, drifts
horizontally off the face column, or has a face hole away from the ball centre.
